    <p><b>Coffee </b>grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans.A bad day with coffee is better than a good day without it. I like my coffee like I like myself: strong, sweet, and too hot for you. I would rather suffer with coffee than be senseless. To make me happy: Make me coffee, bring me coffee, be coffee</p>
